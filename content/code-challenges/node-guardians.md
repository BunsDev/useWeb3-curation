Node Guardians is a platform for builders, thinkers, and stakers. Our mission is to bolster innovative and promising crypto ecosystems, and contribute to the future of a decentralized internet. We do this through education and infrastructure.

### Education

Ecosystems need talented builders. There is a need to onboard and upgrade more developers into industry-standard builders across different protocols. We design a catalog of coding challenges that aim to engage smart contract developers of all levels, and equip them with knowledge on how to build safer, better, and smarter.

Beyond practical skills, we also aim to empower the space with theoretical knowledge in an unbiased manner, through growing a library of literature on crypto history, technology, and economics, written by us and the community.

### Infrastructure

Ecosystems need decentralized security. For proof-of-stake chains, this means more stakers and validators. We provide infrastructure for non-custodial staking that places an emphasis on availability and security. This enables users to stake their assets, act as validators in the ecosystem, and earn rewards.

On-chain governance is taken very seriously at Node Guardians. As validators, we aim to vote on proposals that push towards more decentralized & robust protocols, and proposals that are aligned with our communityâ€™s interests.  Expect full transparency on our governance choices through regular recaps.
