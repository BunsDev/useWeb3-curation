Whether you’re starting out developing your first smart contract, or you’ve already written and deployed a few of them, there’s going to be a point where you’ll wonder how the interaction with your smart contracts is made possible. In this post we’re going to explore ABI encoding, the encoding format used to talk to an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) to execute smart contract functions.

This will be a bit of a deep dive and fairly interactive, so buckle up.
I hope you’ll enjoy it!
