There's a lot of puzzle pieces around here. Let's take a look at what each Python tool does, why it exists, and how to get started. Note that this will probably never be an exhaustive list, but [ping me](https://twitter.com/wolovim) if you want to suggest the inclusion of another tool. At the end of the post, we'll discuss how to put the pieces together to build your own project.
