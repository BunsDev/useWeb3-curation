I don’t know about you dear reader, but I hate reading research papers. They are overly complex, introduce inhuman scribbles called “scientific notation” and are pain to read. So, I won’t go through Ethereum yellow paper, but rather we’ll go deep into go-ethereum - Ethereum execution client implementation in Go language.
