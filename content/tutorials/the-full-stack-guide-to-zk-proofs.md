In this series we try to demystify zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for the rest of non-math nerds. Since writing [part 1](https://dev.to/tonyolendo/the-complete-full-stack-guide-to-getting-started-with-zero-knowledge-proofs-using-circom-and-zk-snarks-part-1-53gi), my thoughts on the subject have evolved. I’m more drawn to answering the following questions

- Can anyone be a ZK developer?
- Is there a simple path that we can define for anyone to get started in writing ZK circuits?

The simple answer to all the questions above is yes! Most assuredly, yes. How? Just learn [Circom](https://iden3.io/circom) and you’ll be well on your way.
