## TL;DR

- Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can cryptographically prove a statement is true without revealing the statement itself. They offer a new level of privacy in digital transactions, allowing for verification without compromising sensitive data.
- Zk-SNARKs, which stand for Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge, are a type of ZKPs. ‘ Succinct’ and ‘Non-interactive’ highlight their efficient performance, while ‘Zero-knowledge’ refers to their privacy-enhancing feature. They are becoming increasingly important in the blockchain world, significantly improving both scalability & privacy.
