title: "Learn How to integrate UniswapV3 into your smart contracts."
description: "Uniswap was the first protocol to take DEX to the next level with an automated market maker (AMM). The AMM eliminates the need for a peer to make a trade, as is the case with traditional order books in todayâ€™s stock market. Instead, the AMM algorithm gathers liquidity deposited by liquidity providers, who place their assets and enable traders to use it."
