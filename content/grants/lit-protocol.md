Lit Protocol is a decentralized key management network that powers encryption, access control, and automation for web3 applications. Read the [docs](https://developer.litprotocol.com/) to learn more.

The Lit grant program is looking to fund projects that improve developer experience and community development in the web3 ecosystem. We want to support those who are building the infrastructure and applications that will make it easier for people to use and develop Lit-enabled applications.
