The grants program is a multi-level funding structure designed to support many kinds of projects in the ecosystem and help establish Moonbeam as the premier destination for cross-chain connected applications. The program is designed to exemplify community engagement, inclusivity, and transparency while working toward the greater good of the ecosystem by helping projects building on Moonbeam and Moonriver.

Grant allocation is community-directed and funded by the Moonbeam Foundation.
