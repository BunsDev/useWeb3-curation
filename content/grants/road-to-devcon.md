Calling all community organizers!

We are excited to announce that we will be launching a funding round to support and empower the Ethereum community in Southeast Asia. Inspired by the involvement of the flourishing Latin American Ethereum community at Devcon VI in Bogot√°, we aim to create a similar impact in Southeast Asia with the Road to Devcon 7.

One of the reasons we plan to organize Devcon in 2024 instead of 2023 is to give more time for your local communities to grow and blossom. We want to help new grassroots communities sprout up in the infinite garden. Let's see what kind of magic you can create!

In collaboration with the Ecosystem Support team, this funding round will be a wave of small sponsorships (up to $1,000) to help cover costs incurred in organizing small-scale events, such as local meetups or topical workshops, and other local educational initiatives.
